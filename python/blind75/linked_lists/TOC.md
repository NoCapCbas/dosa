## Problem 1: Reverse Linked List
Given the beginning of a singly linked list head, 
reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.

### Example 1:
Input: head = [0,1,2,3]

Output: [3,2,1,0]

### Example 2:
Input: head = []

Output: []


## Problem 2: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
- the lengths of the two lists can be different sizes

### Example 1:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,5]

Output: [1,1,2,3,4,5]

### Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [1,2]

Output: [1,2]

### Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []

Output: []


## Problem 2: Reorder List

### Example 1:



## Problem 3: Remove Nth Node From End  of List
