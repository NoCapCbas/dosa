Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists Solution
Iterative Approach:
    Time Complexity: O(n+m)
        Due to iterating over every item in linked list,
        plus the every item in the second list
    Space Complexity: O(1)
        Only constant variables created

Recursive Approach:
    Time Complexity: O(n+m)
        Due to iterating over every item in linked list,
        plus the every item in the second list
    Space Complexity: O(n+m)
        Due to iterating over every item in linked list,
        plus the every item in the second list the call stack will
        also be n+m
