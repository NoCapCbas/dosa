Use the Engineering method to solve all problems.

## Problem 1:
Provide a recursive solution to solving factorial.


### Example 1:

3 * 2 * 1
Input: 3 
Output: 6

### Example 2:

4 * 3 * 2 * 1
Input: 4 
Output: 24


## Problem 2:
Provide a recursive solution to finding the value that results in the 
greatest factorial value.


### Example 1:

Input: [3, 4, 9] 
Output: 9

### Example 2:

Input: [3, 4, -5, 0] 
Output: 4

## Problem 3:
Sum all the elements in an array

### Example 1:
input: [3,1,2,3,1]
output: 10

## Problem 4:
Remove all target elements from an array
### Example 1:
input: [3,1,2,3,1], 2
output: [3,1,3,1]


## Problem 5:
Return true if an array has palindrome values
### Example 1:
input: [9,4,2,4,9]
output: true
### Example 2:
input: [5,4,2]
output: false


## Problem 6:
Shift the elements in an array by 1 and move the last element to the first
### Example 1:
input: [1,2,3,4,5]
output: [5,1,2,3,4]

## Problem 7:
We'll say that a "skipped pair" in a string is two instances of a char separated by a char. So "AxA" the A's make a pair. Pair's can overlap, so "AxAxA" contains 3 skipped pairs -- 2 for A and 1 for x. Compute the number of skipped pairs in the given string using Recursion (no loops).
### Example 1:
countSkippedPairs("axa") == 1
countSkippedPairs("axax") == 2
countSkippedPairs("aaa") == 1


### Problem 8:
We have a number of bunnies, each with two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively, without loops or multiplication.
