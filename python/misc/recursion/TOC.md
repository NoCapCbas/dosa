Use the Engineering method to solve all problems.

## Problem 1:
Provide a recursive solution to solving factorial.


### Example 1:

3 * 2 * 1
Input: 3 
Output: 6

### Example 2:

4 * 3 * 2 * 1
Input: 4 
Output: 24


## Problem 2:
Provide a recursive solution to finding the value that results in the 
greatest factorial value.


### Example 1:

Input: [3, 4, 9] 
Output: 9

### Example 2:

Input: [3, 4, -5, 0] 
Output: 4
